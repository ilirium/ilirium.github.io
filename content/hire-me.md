**Location:** Brazil

**Remote:** Yes, or Hybrid or Office

**Willing to relocate:** Yes, it is possible

**Technologies:** Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision. Geospational data and IoT sensors (weather
and environmental), satellite images, gridded/array data and time-series.


Hi, I have 12+ years in tech and analytics, of which 4+ years are working as a Data Scientist. I completed PhD degree 8
years ago. I have broad experience with machine/deep learning (ML & DL) and data science in computer vision (CV),
geospatial & climate data. Solid software engineering skills and mindset. I use satellite images, radar data, and
time-series structured data in my projects. Now I am learning Rust and am interested in using it in projects.

Main tech stack: Python and Golang, Numpy, Pandas, SciPy, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, OpenCV, Pillow, Git, Bash, Jupyter,
Matplotlib, PyCharm, Docker, GDAL, PROJ, QGIS, GeoTIFF, HDF5, GRIB, NetCDF4, WKT, optical flow.

Weather and environment data: NOAA, GFS, ERA5, WRF, solar radiation, weather radars, SILAM, WaveWatch and etc.


_Key results related to hard skills:_
- Create, train and tune DL models (classification, segmentation, prediction tasks)
- Statistical processing and data analytics of times series from IoT sensors and satellite images
- Remote sensing and computer vision: georeferencing, warping, image filtering and processing, object recognition,
interpolation
- Benchmarking and speed up: async, threads, multiprocessing, multidimensional array algorithms with Numpy
- Developed backends for data analyzing services and prediction API in Python and Golang
- Dashboard for comparing data sources by different statistic metrics
- Deployed services to production and staging with Docker Compose, GitLab CI/CD and Bash


_Key results related to soft skills:_
- Wide experience of remote work, also before the lockdown
- Defended a Ph.D. degree on time
- Presented research results on scientific conferences (more than 20)
- Retrained myself from a research fellow in the electronics industry to the data scientist in IT
