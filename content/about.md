Hi, I am Ilya Kalimulin. My nickname is Ilirium. It is my personal blog. Currently, my family and I are living in
🇧🇷Brazil (UTC-3). My wife and I have 2 brilliant small kids. Before Brazil, we had the experience of living in 🇮🇳India
(Goa), 🇪🇺European Union (🇱🇻Latvia), and 🇹🇷Turkey. Originally, we were from Russia. I completed my Ph.D. degree in 2014
in the edge of microwave engineering and electronic design automation. Once I gave an
[oral speech](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347123) at a scientific conference in San Jose (California, USA).

I have 12+ years in tech and analytics, of which 4+ years are working as a Data Scientist. From my experience, I am
attracted to working with raster data stored in multidimensional arrays, like images and videos. I use digital filters,
warping, interpolation, resampling, bitmasks, Boolean operations, LUT, removing backgrounds, etc., to process and
generate images in geoimaging (satellite, weather, and environmental data). I gradually realized that all these
operations refer to computer graphics and computer vision. Being involved in machine learning and deep learning
projects, I was also always interested in trying to directly program the GPU and write my own implementation of a neural
network from scratch.

To push my interest in CG generation, CV, and GPU programming beyond job tasks, I found the WGPU project and did some
basic things with it with the Python wrapper and WGSL. Then I decided to work closer with WGPU and started to learn
Rust (I am reading the book by Blandy/Orendorff/Tindall). Nicely, Rust and WGSL have some commons :) I am thinking about
implementing 3 pet projects: a 2D raster engine (kind of “TinyDirec2D”), graphics and computer vision engine (
“TinySkia” + “TinyOpenCV”), and “TinyTorch” in Rust and WGSL on top of WebGPU.

I want to use this blog as a platform to showcase my experiments in the directions I have voiced and write articles &
posts on technical topics of interest to me. At some point, I found that sharing my small steps motivates me to move
forward. Equally important to me is sharing knowledge and experience with other people and the community through
articles, as I have learned a lot from reading other people’s articles & posts.

Here are some more words about my background :) In the past, with several colleagues from the university, we applied our
research to make a startup, which was a cloud-based simulation tool for electronics. As Data Scientist, I work with
PyTorch, Numpy, and OpenCV. I developed a service to process weather radar images. I did experiments and developed MVP
for pixel-classification of satellite images to predict the type of crops (CNN, RNN, LSTM).
