Hi, bits, bytes, and alives! I decided to start blogging. From time to time, I write some notes and thoughts or share
links with my friends in messengers. I've sometimes wondered if I should start a blog. With the emerging of my interest
in Rust, WebAssembly, and WebGPU, I decided to do it.

But my interest is wider than the things mentioned above. I have thoughts in my head about Python and Go, NumPy,
PyTorch, Pandas, asynchronous/parallel programming (async/await, multithreading, coroutines, channels, etc.),
implementing algorithms in multidimensional arrays (NumPy), computer vision, machine and deep learning, and
raster/gridded data.

Writing blog posts is new for me, so I need to figure out how frequently I can do it.

Thanks for reading, and stay tuned!
